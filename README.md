# Source-Camera-Identification

Source Camera Identification is a novel problem of detection the cmaera source of a given image. This problem is challenging due to the fact that current methods are based on feature extraction, feature enhancement, etc. but in source camera identification, we have nothing to do with the content of the image but we need to use camera sensor attributes like noise patterns, color densities, etc. to classify image into the respective camera classes.

We are students at UPES, Dehradun pursuing B.Tech CSE Hons. with specialisation AIML and we chose this problem as our Minor Project I in Semester 5.
